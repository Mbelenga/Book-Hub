                <p>This book is suitable for use in a university-level first course in computing (CS1), as well as the increasingly popular course known as CS0. It is difficult for many students to master basic concepts in computer science and programming. A large portion of the confusion can be blamed on the complexity of the tools and materials that are traditionally used to teach CS1 and CS2. This textbook was written with a single overarching goal: to present the core concepts of computer science as simply as possible without being simplistic.</p>

Now At $55.99 instead of $ 86,78 Includes 3 manuscripts Learn Python Programming In today's Industry, Python Programming is highly recommended for developing Websites. The creator of this programming language was Guido Van Rossum, released first in the year 1991. The multiple supporting programming paradigms made itself unique from other programming languages as it had some outstanding features like unique adaptability, the ability to adopt machine learning, scientific computation, cloud infrastructure and above all web development. Python's role is really commendable in both software development, as well as, web development. This book is helpful for learning everything Python has to offer.By connecting with a database system Python can read and modify files. To create workflows in Software, this language is helpful. Python also supports a dynamic type system, automatic memory management, object-oriented and structured programming. Moreover, this programming language has the potential to support the various concepts in functional and aspect-oriented programming. Where the other programming languages use semicolon or parentheses to complete a command, Python uses new lines to complete it. Python Coding and Programming Python is one of the easiest computer languages to learn. The most striking part of this language is that it is widely used in NASA. The developers should focus on the quality of the source code to simplify its uses. Other programming languages never focused on the code readability, but Python is always ready to strengthen the code readability with the help of English keywords. Writing additional code is not necessary for Python to create custom applications. When you want to learn a language understood by computers, all over the world, you should take the help of this eBook. It supports several programming paradigms like logic programming and design by contract. In late 1980, as a legatee to the ABC language, the python was conceived. The exceptional powerful ideology of this programming language has influenced many other languages, like BOO, GOBRA, JULIA, RUBY, SWIFT, etc, and those languages hire Python designs for their development. Linux for beginners For computers, servers, mainframes, mobile, and embedded devices, Linux is an open-source and community-developed and operating system. As it is an open source OS, the code is free to create Linux. That's why the appropriate skills for the users are necessary, even if they are beginners, so that they can get the best out of the operating system. This is not only used by the web programmers but also by the regular computer or laptop users and even mobile phones . Get hold of the eBook to learn more. As it is a bit different from the popular operating system like Windows or Android, it takes a little bit of time to get the hang of it. The most important thing about Linux that it is free. It is really hard to hack into Linux as it is highly secured. For different types of users, there are different flavors and the available flavors are called 'distributions'.
